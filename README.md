## To Get This Application Up and Running

### Step one: Download Android Studio.
  - If it asks you to choose an API version, please choose Android 14.0 ("UpsideDownCake")
### Step two: Clone this repo into Android Studio
  - This is done by linking your GitHub account to Android Studio, then pressing "Git" on the toolbar, then "clone". Then, all you have to do is copy and paste the URL :).
### Step three: Adding a Device.
  - A vertical taskbar is on the right side of the application. Click the "Device Manager", then click the "+" sign (when hovered over, it should say 'Add a new device'), then click 'Create Virtual Device'.
  - A page will pop up labeled "Virtual Device Configuration", and you are going to want to select "Pixel 5" (with a little bit of scrolling). Click 'Next'. This will lead you to something called "System Image". Make sure you click "UpsideDownCake" (also called API 34). (If it is not downloaded, that is completely okay! Just allow it to do so.) Then, click 'Next'. This will help you verify the configuration. Top to bottom, it should read: "pixel 5", "UpsideDownCake", "Preferred ABI: Optimal", "Startup orientation: Portrait", "Emulated Performace: Software", "Device Frame is enabled." Then, click 'Finish'.
  - When you click "Device Manager" again, it should show your new phone "Pixel 5 API 34". Click play! (represented by the arrow).

### Step Four: Run our App
- Now that the Pixel device is running, we need to actually run our program! In the top of the page, you will see the following: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e8730c7-8917-499a-930d-d60a1fff3807) Make sure that is how it looks; otherwise, click the dropdown until it looks like that. Then, click play (![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/492493b8-7e1b-4dab-b190-6bcd2e389f2b)
